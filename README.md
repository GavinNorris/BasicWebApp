# BasicWebApp
 This project will be created without the assistance of AI in any form. The goal is to create a basic web app with broad functionality that can be adapted for more specific purposes

With the ever evolving nature of AI, it has become more and more easy and acceptable to use AI to create some or all of a project without understanding any code within. In order to combat this and present myself as a more knowledgable programmer, I will not utilize AI to generate any code for this project, and every line of code written will be understood fully.

There will be a set of guidelines for this project:
- No generative AI will create code for use in this project
- No code will be written that is not understood
- I will be the only one allowed to edit this code
- A focus on vanilla javascript implementation will be priority, and libraries will not be relied on too much if it can be avoided
- Due to my current knowledge at the time of creation, express and node will be used for backend development
- Database setup will not be a main focus of this project initially, but will be a goal to work towards. Additional research into what language to use will be required
- Frontend and backend development will be the primary goal
- Beginning with HTML, I will work more towards the backend features. All code (including HTML) must be understood
- Due to the nature of the project, more work will be done outside of public visibility
- A general Web page/app will be produced when the project is finished
- There will be no set deadline for this project
    - This project is designed to be for personal enjoyment and improvement, and as such it is to be more of a process than a product
